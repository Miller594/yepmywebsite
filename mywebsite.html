    <h1>Greater Germanic Reich</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOfficial Name: Greater Germanic Reich
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRuling Party: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIdeology: National Socialism
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter a series of stunning victories against France, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, Adolf Hitler's new order was to reign supreme for a thousand years. Instead, cruelty, arrogance, corruption and incompetent leadership has brought the Reich to the brink of economic and military collapse. As the new decade turns, Germany's status as a dominant world power is threatened by an increasingly bloated military, a dysfunctional economy reliant on slave labor and a vast number of enemies both external and internal. Now as the Führer's life draws to an end, ambitious men plot to take over the crumbling empire by any means necessary

    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDystopia Is Hard: Systematic oppression has done nothing but cause trouble for German society, and Germany is on the verge of collapse because of the NSDAP's incompetence and hubris. It's not even like the existential problems facing the Reich are that far-fetched, as the German war effort in real life was badly kneecapped by the same kind of extensive corruption and wastefulness. Had the Reich somehow survived in real life, it probably would have faced similar dilemmas to what's depicted here.

        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Empire: During the Second World War, the Greater Germanic Reich conquered many other countries and greatly expanded its territory. By 1962, Germany is one of the dominant world powers, controlling large swathes of land in both Europe and Africa.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnemy Civil War: The German Civil War between 4 contenders for the Führership starts almost immediately after Hitler dies. If Göring, Heydrich or Schörner comes into power, Germany proper can also go to war with its own protectorates and commissariats as well.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFascist, but Inefficient: Germany's economic, social, and military problems have created a nearly failed state by the 1960s, held together only by strict repression. An inevitable civil war results, and this need not be the end of the crisis should the victor not attempt useful reforms.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHoist by His Own Petard: Germany's desire to see through the Atlantropa project and reshape Europe completely destroyed them; their Mediterranean allies left the Axis, and their own economy crashed due to the expenses spent on Atlantropa, which led to massively increased internal dissent that eventually culminates in the German Civil War.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNEET: Because of the extensive slave system, most German students can only go to school, and don't really need employment or training, giving them way too much free time. As a result, students spend half their time partying, leading to cliques and youth groups; add in the natural liberal tilt of most universities and access to American media and Karl Marx's writings through the black market, this ultimately gives rise to the growing student movement.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of the Frying Pan: Managed poorly, the new German state established in the aftermath of the German Civil War can collapse again, though little detail has been released on what exactly happens during the second collapse.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlease Select New City Name: As part of Albert Speer's Welthauptstadt Germania project, Berlin was renamed to Germania.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPyrrhic Victory: Germany ultimately won the West Russian War, but the war caused the German economy to further go down the gutter, caused a crisis in the SS that led to Himmler creating Burgundy and going rogue, and overall greatly increased unrest within Germany. The war dealt such a massive damage that the German Civil War can be directly attributed to it.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSlave Race: After having learnt the hard way that genocide operations like the Holocaust and Generalplan Ost were massively unprofitable, Nazi Germany converted them into slavery programs to prop up the failing German economy. By 1962, most of the Untermenschen are enslaved instead of being exterminated, and slavery forms a massive component of German economy, with a counter in Speer's menu saying that over 38 million people are enslaved following the end of the GCW.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspState Sec: Though most of the SS has been kicked into Burgundy after Himmler's attempted coup, a large section of the SS have remained in Germany, now under Reinhard Heydrich's command, and are still fanatically loyal to Himmler and his ideals despite everything.

    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter being humiliated in the Second World War and seeing Hawaii nuked by the Axis, America was forced to cede the archipelago and other Pacific territories as well as the ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco on the West Coast to Japan. This failure has left much of the population angry and itching for revenge. As the 1960s begin, America's political elites seek to lead the world's remaining democratic power in a Cold War against German Fascism and Japanese Imperialism. As CIA analysts predict the impending collapse of Germany and Japan, President Richard Nixon seeks to palliate the anger and worry of various groups of American citizens while containing the expansionism of the other superpowers. In the meantime, various fringe political groups wait for their occasion to introduce new ideologies to an America increasingly divided by both the Cold War and Civil Rights issues.

    <br>
    
    
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCavalry Betrayal: During the South African War, if Wolfgang Schenck grants independence to the Republic of Angola, the OFN under the United States will immediately declare war on the newly-independent and anti-Schild Angola, since the OFN wants resources more than independent anti-Nazi allies.
    <br>
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChummy Commies: Without the threat of the Soviet Union and with the dominance of the German Reich, Americans in this timeline are more sympathetic to leftist ideologies, with the US government supporting communist rebels abroad and the left wing of the NPP advocating for socialism at home.
    <br>
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspControl Freak: The US holds a strong grip over other OFN countries, especially Iceland (which is ruled by an American military administration), in fear that if they are not properly controlled, those countries would leave their alliance or even join another superpower.
    <br>
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDark Horse Victory: It is very unlikely that either the L-NPP or the Yockeys become popular within the NPP and win the presidential elections, and if they do, it's a sign something has gone horribly wrong in America.

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen german force march into Moscow, Soviet government surrender to Third German Reich. But resistance didn't stop. The remnants of the Soviet government went to siberia, in siberia they re-build the soviet government, and re-group the remnants of the Red Army. They push back to east europe, but they failed. This mainly cause economic collapse of Greater Germania Reich. 
    With the retreat of the Red Army, more and more power stand up to against the Soviet Government. After a few years's resistance, the government collapse, it broke into dozens of pieces expect Irkuzk and Buryatia, these two provinces are still under control of the Government until 1962.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSablin was born in Leningrad, 1939. His father was a general for Naval, he command his ship towards to germany naval ship. So Sablin was grow up in a unstable environment. When he found the remanants of the Red Army, he joined them and become a political commissar under the command of Yagoda(He is also the president of Soviet Government) As time flows, he became unable to bear with the brutal rule of Yagoda.
    Finally, when his company was building a bam near Baikal lake, he and his loyal soldiers went in a Radio tower near Upper Udinsk(It changed its name to Ulan-Ude later) Where, they broadcast the brutal rule of Yagoda and call on people to resist him.

    Offical name: China Republic

    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the streets of Chongqing, two titans of the Republican era died fighting side by side. Their bodies were retrieved, strung, and hung before the backdrop of a razed city. With that the Republic would capitulate and in its place would rise the Reorganized Government of China. Claiming to be the legitimate executor of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen’s vision, the RGOC was founded in collaboration between prominent Kuomintang figure Wang Jing-Wei and the Empire of Japan. Unreleased treaties between the governments arranging for Japanese support would reveal a grim picture for China’s future as a colony for the Japanese.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe end of the Pacific War brought the beginning of a new era for China. One of increased oppression, of mass rape and lootings, of setbacks, but then: stability. What followed the 1947 peace agreements was unpleasant to many but offered peace and the potential for growth to a country that had spent the previous decades in constant chaos. The Japanese occupation purged dissent and Japanese subsidies allowed for the rebuilding of infrastructure and homes, meaning the Chinese people could finally worry less about war and more about working. The transition was not all pleasant—the Japanese pillaged what industry they could and seized control of former business assets—but it was calm enough. Former soldiers returned home, trading rifle for plow and tending to the soil long neglected in the face of war. What resulted was the “Agrarian Boom” of the 1950s, an explosion in Chinese crop exports that sent food prices across the war-torn Sphere spiraling down. Regions on the brink of famine were saved and the newly-Japanese possessions were able to rebuild faster than otherwise possible. For this contribution, the Reorganized Government is often called the “Breadbasket of the Sphere”, a demonym that shows the importance of China within the sphere but also its limitations. In truth, the war and subsequent occupation of China meant that China had regressed into an agrarian society with pockets of poorly utilized industrial sectors surrounding urban areas. Commerce was Japanese and what was manufactured in China usually did not stay there long.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Reorganized Government was marketed to the Chinese people as an alternative government to Chiang’s KMT, and initially made well of promises for a state more in line with Dr. Sun’s Republican vision. But as time passed and the Japanese victory became more and more certain, more and more restrictions were placed on the government. At first the Japanese were “preferential trade partners,” then they were “international intermediaries” until the Japanese treaty port in Shanghai regulated all trade flowing up and down the Yangtze river. The office of President of the Republic exists still and while at present powerless to face the Japanese still holds considerable influence regarding domestic affairs.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe death of Wang Jing-Wei in 1944 ushered Chen Gongbo to assume the office of President. Gongbo oversaw the end of the war and the solidification of the RGOC’s authority over western China. Due to ailing health and perceived “weakness” by the Legislative Yuan regarding the integration of warlord states, Gongbo resigned from the Presidency in 1951 in favor of a cabinet position. What followed was a half-decade long internal power struggle with the C-KMT’s “Reformist” clique at odds with the R-KMT’s “Old Guard” clique. Candidates would promise deals to the Japanese for support, only to be left in the cold upon their assumption of power. From this malaise, the Japanese gained full control over all Chinese exports and considerable extraterritorial rights that only consolidated China’s Yamato subservience.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTheir solution was to elect a relative unknown with Reformist ideals but Old Guard credibility who was capable of working with the Japanese. He was a former diplomat, serving the RGOC alongside Wang Jing-Wei as an intermediary between Tokyo and Nanjing. An ardent believer in Chinese unity and a devoted follower of Dr. Sun’s ideals, he left Chiang’s regime in the hopes of saving China. It would seem that now he would have his chance. As he approached the podium of the Legislative Yuan his posture displayed him as a slouched, aging diplomat no different from the 51 party members surrounding him. But behind his spectacles, his eyes showed his true character: a fiery spirit poised on righting the skewed course China had taken, one willing to correct the mistakes he’d witnessed over his two decades of service by any means possible. He was their stallion, their hopeful, their last shot. He was ​Gao Zongwu​.

        <br>
        Ideology: Libertarian socialism, Authoritarian socialism (Bukharinist)
        <br>
        <a href="https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/23a6ed4f82c48675d79f9a25062d617ef91a4d74.png@312w_420h.webp" target="_blank">Photo</a>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspValery Mikhailovich Sablin, born in 1939, grew up in the Union's tattered and shackled remains under Chairman Yagoda. Knowing little about his Union or the revolution his father died fighting for, Sablin became a commissar not to serve the dubiously moral Yagoda, but to seek answers in the remnant military academies. The censored pages Sablin saw only further disheartened him to Yagoda's cause, and the bloody Central Siberian War became the final testament of Yagoda's tyranny.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSablin mutinied against Yagoda, crying out to the people to stand against tyrants in a defiant broadcast; the people answered and flocked to join his revolution. Buryatia was liberated, yet Yagoda reacts to crush their revolution. Thoughts of idealism and pragmatism, challenge and hardship, and the spirits of Lenin and Bukharin cross Sablin's mind. If dreams could truly survive and thrive, then onwards, to the Red October Forevermore.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLike Lazar Kaganovich of Tyumen, Sablin is a Hero-Worshipper of a historical leader of the Soviet Union (Josef Stalin in Kaganovich's case, Vladimir Lenin in Sablin's case), and both set out to form a new Soviet Union in their idol's image. Unlike Kaganovich, Sablin is potentially capable of fulfilling the ideals of his idol without necessarily crossing the line into purging any opposition to his vision, and can potentially form a socialist democracy. In comparison, Kaganovich's zealous admiration of Stalin results in the single worst iteration of a reforged Soviet Union possible, even when compared to Genrikh Yagoda, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, or Andrei Zhadanov, and has no chance of making it remotely accountable to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp·Allohistorical Allusion: In real life, Sablin led a mutiny in 1975 in the hope of starting a Leninist revolution in the Soviet Union, which ended in failure and his execution. In this timeline, he also mutinied and revolted against the Soviet Union (or what remains of it) in the name of Lenin's ideals, albeit under very different circumstances.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp·The Dark Side Will Make You Forget: If Sablin takes too many Authoritarian Socialist "Bukharinist" options, he's still trying to follow Lenin's ideals, but also purges anybody who stands in his way.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp·Defector from Decadence: Disappointed by Yagoda's tyrannical leadership and degradation of Lenin's ideals, Sablin chose to revolt in order to inspire the people into a new Leninist revolution.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp·Fallen Hero: Should Sablin take too many Authoritarian Socialist options on his tree, he essentially begins purging anyone who gets in the way of Leninist ideals, making him Not So Different from Yagoda.

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJohn Glenn, the first human being to enter space, one of the greatest presidents in American history. During his tenure, politically, the civil rights issue finally settled, and the U.S. welfare and social safety net construction made great progress. At the diplomatic level, Glenn used extreme pressure to successfully promote the nuclear negotiations among the three major powers in the world and cut The world’s nuclear arsenal; in addition, it is worth mentioning that during the Glenn administration, the United States became the second country in the world to land on the moon and the first country to land on Mars, and it also became the country with the most developed nuclear energy construction.
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn 1981, with Himmler's death, Burgundy fell into chaos, and Himmler's evil plan was finally known. According to reliable information, at the moment when the three countries successfully signed the nuclear disarmament agreement, Himmler was so angry that he even sent an assassin to assassinate Glenn. When the assassination failed and Glenn announced that he would not give up negotiations, Himmler almost fainted with anger. After this secret was made public, the world really knew that Glenn’s nuclear disarmament was so significant that it could be said to have saved the entire world. Therefore, when talking about Glenn, the people will always comment on him, "Save the world!"

        Ideology: Burgundian System

    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEven before taking the post of Reichsführer of the German SS after Himmler's attempted coup, Reinhard Heydrich was already known in Germany as an exceptionally brutal and fanatical man, who killed and terrorized his way up the Nazi hierarchy. Now, leading the German SS, the Blonde Beast fully commits himself to Himmler and the principles of the Burgundian System. Heydrich will stop at nothing to fulfill Himmler's orders to totally remake the complacent and decadent Reich in the Spartanist image.
        <br>
        <strong>...unless the orders themselves demand otherwise.</strong>
        <br>
            Downplayed. His sheer brutality makes him widely hated within Germany, outside of the German SS. However, most of the German SS only supports him because Himmler does and, if Himmler orders his execution, hardly anyone objects to this.
        <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf Heydrich wins the German Civil War, when he betrays Himmler, he alienates the entirety of the SS and loses whatever little support he has left. When both Germany and Burgundy break up into multiple warlord states, none of the warlord states are loyal to him at the start (aside from Herbert Otto Gille if he takes control of the Kommandostab Waffen-SS). Most of the SS-Idealist warlords are loyal to Himmler, most of the SS-Pragmatist warlords pursue their own agendas over Heydrich's, and the GCW faction remnants and the slave revolt definitely don't want to associate themselves with Heydrich. Heydrich has to use significant effort to win the warlords' allegiance so he can fight Himmler.
    <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ain't Too Proud to Beg: Even a person as brutal as Heydrich still fears death, and especially death at the hands of his master. If the Civil War enters the Anarchy stage and Himmler considers eliminating him, Heydrich will attempt to beg him for both forgiveness and more time to win the Civil War.
<br>
         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlas, Poor Villain: Despite being one of the most horrendous and brutal Nazis both in-game and in real life, Heydrich's final storyline is very somber and portrays him in a sympathetic light as the plot advances. Initially, he vomits after he reads Himmler's plans, utterly shocked at the madman's goal. A few days later, the stunned Heydrich scrambles for what little officers he can scrounge up, and starts to eat meat, smoke, and drink himself to stupidity, defiling what little Spartanist ideals he had. As days pass, and confrontation between Himmler advances, his health rapidly deteriorates from the sheer tobacco and alcohol abuse, unable to look in the eye of his family. If he wins the confrontation, he realizes his entire ideology was built on bunk since he had to cooperate with even "subhuman" Poles who showed nothing but honesty in their dealings, spilled more "Aryan" blood across two civil wars than any supposed Jewish plot ever did, and his idol was nothing but a utter maniac with no grasp on sanity. He kills himself from the mental breakdown. If he loses the nuke supremacy during the confrontation, giving Himmler enough arsenal to start the global holocaust, he screams the names of his children in horror and agony, trying to find a safe place to send them, even the "Jewish United States" in tears. Even Evil Has Loved Ones indeed.
<br>
         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmazon Brigade: One of the focuses in Heydrich's Deutsch-SS path in his civil war tree sees Heydrich allow recruitment of women into the military due to the difficulty of their situation, spawning an elite division of female soldiers and "liberalizing" the women military law from "Banned From Service" to "Combat Roles"; he justifies it by saying that ancient Germanic tribes brought women into their battles too. It's amusing in a very dark way.
<br>
         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspApe Shall Never Kill Ape: A key contributing factor to Heydrich's Heel Realization is that, thanks to him, two different civil wars resulted in more spilled "Aryan" blood than any perceived Jewish plot (to say nothing of Himmler's psychotic plans to wipe the entire world out with atomic fire.
<br>
         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAuthority in Name Only: Germany under Heydrich falls into a de facto state of warlordism; Heydrich's authority exists in name only and only encompasses the region around Germania, while the rest of the country is controlled by a multitude of regional leaders with differing allegiances.
<br>
         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAssassin Outclassin': In this timeline, Heydrich survived the assassination attempt that historically claimed his life in 1942. In 1950, he survived another assassination attempt, with the would-be assassin dead before he even entered the same building as Heydrich.
